Generating Connections
----------------------

Manually
********

When drawing a connection line between two connector icons:

* a ``connect`` equation with the references to the two connectors is created,

* with a graphical annotation defining the connection path as an array of points and providing an optional smoothing function e.g. Bezier.

    * When no smoothing function is specified the connection path must be rendered graphically as a set of segments.

    * The array of points is either:

        * created fully automatically when the next user's click after having started a connection is made on a connector icon. The function call ``create_new_path(connector1, connector2)`` creates the minimum number of *vertical or horizontal* segments to link the two connector icons with the constraint of avoiding overlaying any instantiated object,

        * created semi automatically based on the input points corresponding to the user clicks outside any connector icon: the function call `create_new_path(point[i], point[i+1])` is called to generate the path linking each pair of points together.

Automatically

Fluid Connectors
................

Natural mapping for a model with two fluid ports (most common case):

* ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a``: inlet
* ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_b``: outlet

For more than two fluid ports e.g. coil we could use the variable name:

* ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a port_a1``: primary fluid (liquid) inlet
* ``Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort_a port_a2``: secondary fluid (air) inlet

However that logic fails when the ports correspond to the same medium:

* ``Buildings.Fluid.Actuators.Dampers.MixingBox``: ``port_Out, port_Exh, port_Ret, port_Sup``
* ``Buildings.Fluid.Actuators.Valves.ThreeWayEqualPercentageLinear``: ``port_1, port_2, port_3``
* ``Buildings.Fluid.HeatExchangers.PlateHeatExchangerEffectivenessNTU``: ``port_a1, port_a2, port_b1, port_b2``

For the configuration script:

* By default ``port_a`` and ``port_b`` will be tagged as ``inlet`` and ``outlet`` respectively.

* An optional tag is provided at the instance level to specify the fluid path e.g. ``air_supply`` or ``air_return``.

* All fluid connectors are then tagged by concatenating the previous tags e.g. ``air_supply_inlet`` or ``air_return_outlet``.

We need an additional mechanism to allow tagging each fluid port individually. Typically for a three way valve (see [figure](#connect_3wv)), the bypass port should be on a different fluid path than the inlet and outlet ports see figure. Hence we need a mapping dictionary at the connector level which, if provided, takes precedence on the default logic specified above.
Furthermore a fluid connector can be connected to more than one other fluid connector. To support that feature another connector tag value is possible: ``junction``.
For a three way valve without any flow splitter to explicitly model the fluid junction the mapping dictionary could be:

``{"port_1": "hotwater_return_inlet", "port_2": "hotwater_return_outlet", "port_3": "hotwater_supply_junction"}``

The conversion script throws an exception if the instantiated class has some fluid ports that cannot be tagged with the previous logic e.g. non default names and no (or incomplete) mapping dictionary provided.

If the tagging is resolved for all fluid connectors of the instantiated objects the connector tags are stored in a hierarchical vendor annotation at the model level e.g. ``__Linkage_connect(Tags(object_name1={connector_name1=air_supply_inlet, connector_name2=air_supply_outlet, ...}, ...))``. This is done when updating the model.

All object names in ``__Linkage_tags(Tags())`` annotation reference instantiated objects with fluid ports that have to be connected to each other. To build the full connection set, two additional inputs are needed:

1. The names of the start port and the end port for each fluid path. Note that those ports may be part of a different fluid path see figure.

2. The direction (horizontal or vertical) of the connection path.

Those are stored in ``__Linkage_connect(Direction(fluid_path1={start_connector_name, end_connector_name, horizontal_or_vertical}))``.

The connection logic is then as follows:

* List all the different fluid paths in ``__Linkage_connect(Tags())`` corresponding to each tuple ``{fluid}_{path}`` in all the connector tags ``{fluid}_{path}_{port}``.

* For each fluid path:

      * Find the position of the objects corresponding to the start and end ports specified in ``__Linkage_connect(Direction(fluid_path1={start_connector_name, end_connector_name}))``. Those are further referred to as start and end position.

      * | Find the orientation (up, down, right, left) of the direction (horizontal, vertical) of the connection path by comparing the ``x`` (resp. ``y``) coordinate values of the start and end position if the direction is horizontal (resp. vertical).

        | Throw an exception if the orientation cannot be resolved due to identical coordinate values.

      * Order all the connectors belonging to that fluid path according to the orientation defined here above and based on the position of the corresponding objects with the constraint that for each object ``inlet`` has to be listed first and ``outlet`` last. Prepend / append that list with the start and end connectors.

      * Generate the ``connect`` equations by iterating on the ordered list of connectors as illustrated in the pseudo code below. And generate the connection path and the corresponding graphical annotation see listing :ref:`code_connect_fluid`.

      :name: code_connect_fluid

      i = 1
      while i < n
      j = i + 1
      if type(ordered_connector[i]) == "junction"  // connect all junction connectors before iterating
            while type(ordered_connector[j]) == "junction"
                  connect(ordered_connector[i], ordered_connector[j])
                  annotation(Line(points=create_new_path(ordered_connector[i], ordered_connector[j])))
                  j = j + 1
            i = j
      else
            connect(ordered_connector[i], ordered_connector[j])
            annotation(Line(points=create_new_path(ordered_connector[i], ordered_connector[j])))
            i = j + 1

![Generating connections with a fluid junction not modeled explicitly (typically a three way valve)][connect_3wv_junction]
*Generating connections with a fluid junction modeled explicitly (typically a three way valve)*

The implications of that logic are the following:

* Within the same fluid path objects are connected in a given direction and orientation: to represent a fluid loop (graphically) at least two fluid paths must be defined, typically ``supply`` and ``return``.

* A same fluid path does not necessarily imply a uniform flow rate.

      }

Issues:

* We have a linked modelica model residing on disk. When loading that model, LinkageJS must be able to:

  * identify which object and ``connect`` statement can be modified with the template script: declaration/statement annotation ``__Linkage_modify=true``
  * generate the JSON configuration file:

    * automatically from the model structure? Non working examples:

      * Supply fan/Draw through: if the user has modified the ``Placement`` we have no one-to-one correspondance with JSON file. Also relying on the ``connect`` statements involving the object seems to complex.


Notes:

* Icon for schematics can be specified as annotation in Modelica model (the icon transformation should be similar between Modelica and svg)

Divers:

* Tooltip for every GUI item


Questions:

* Validation upon submit (export/generate) VS real-time
* Routine to add sensors for control sequences
* Routine to add fluid ports: part of data model?

## Questions

Choice of units: SI / IP

Text editor

Launch simulation integrated

* At least compilation required to validate the model?
* For control sequence configuration the model may not need to be fully specified.

Visualize results: variable browser (with Brick/Haystack option similar as ``re`` option)

No icon layer: just diagram layer showing graphical objects, component icons, connectors and connection lines

Automatic medium propagation between connected components

* Expected as a future enhancement of Modelica standard: should we anticipate or wait and see?

## Requirements

Modelica standard graphical annotations part of specification

## Notes

### Brick and tagging

Set up parameters values like OS measures enable cf. electrical loads...

### Various

From Taylor Eng.

> For standard systems, it might be possible to simply include in their specifications a table of ASHRAE Guideline 36 sequences with check boxes for the paragraph numbers that are applicable to their project.

From https://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Modelica.Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.FluidConnectors.html

With the current library design, it is necessary to explicitly select the medium model for each component in a circuit. This model is then propagated to the ports, and a Modelica translator will check that the quantity and unit attributes of connected interfaces are identical. Therefore, an error occurs, if connected FluidPorts do not have a medium with the same medium name. In the future, automatic propagation of fluid models through the ports will be introduced, but this still not possible with Modelica 3.0.
