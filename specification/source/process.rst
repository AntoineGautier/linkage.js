Process Workflow
----------------


a design engineer selects, configures, tests and evaluates the performance of a control sequence
using building energy simulation (2),
starting from a control sequence library that contains ASHRAE GPC 36 sequences,
as well as user-added sequences (3),
linked to a model of the mechanical system and the building (4).
If the sequences meet closed-loop performance requirements,
the designer exports a control specification,
including the sequences and functional verification tests expressed in
the Controls Description Language CDL (5).
Optionally, for reuse in similar projects,
